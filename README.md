# OOPs in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the general structure of classes in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. It aims to help you learn how to build your own classes, specialized to your needs.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Learn the general structure of classes in OOP using Python
- Learn how to build your own class using OOP, specialized to your needs

## Files

- **OOPs_Building_Classes.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and explanations for understanding and building classes using OOP in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install Jupyter Notebook using `pip`:

```sh
pip install notebook
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Oops-in-Python.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd Oops-in-Python
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `OOPs_Building_Classes.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to explore the concepts of building classes using OOP in Python.
